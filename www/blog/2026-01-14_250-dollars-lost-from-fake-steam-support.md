title: That Time When I Lost $250 From Fake Steam Support
description: While clearing my website, I saw that one fact about me talking about when I got scammed through Discord for $250. Maybe it's time for me to talk about it.

**Note:** It's been 3-4 years since it happened, and I already forgot some parts of the timeline, but I think you'll still get the idea.

It was almost the end of 2022, and I was using my computer. Suddenly, I got this message from someone who claimed that he and "his friends" mistakenly reported my Steam account. I checked the account, and it seemed legit. There was a message indicating that I had actually been reported. He then told me to contact the Steam Support through... *discord*, with a screenshot of a fake message from Gaben.

Keep in mind, **Steam Support doesn't have Discord, and even if your account is reported, it doesn't actually get banned right away.**

However, I just went with it and talked to the "Steam Support" on Discord, just like what that guy said. That "support" then asked me to show my purchased library of games and maybe some other things that I can't remember, so I did (sort of). But then they told me that my account would be removed due to credit card fraud, and in order to appeal, I had to pay a whole lot of money. I can't remember how much, but I think it's somewhere around 300 to 500 dollars. They claimed that they would pay me back, but spoiler alert, they didn't.

But it's still a lot of money. So I told them that I don't have enough money, and then I think that "support" told me to give them access to my account, and I had to log out. So... I did (sort of). They got my account, changed my profile picture, and display name to look like my account is gone. But here's the thing: I was still kind of skeptical about it, and I still had my Steam account logged in on my browser. So I locked my account, and I don't know what the hell-fridge was going on, I got both me and that "support" locked out from accessing my Steam account.

Even though it's supposed to end here, I did the stupidest thing ever—I still kept talking with them. Since they couldn't get my account, they asked me to pay up. And it's not like paying them directly using money; I had to buy them Steam Gift Cards from the link that they sent to me. At first, I thought it was one, but they came up with the excuse of the gift card being "unusable." So I bought another one for them. Actually, I had to buy the third one for their same excuse they came up too, but they left, and that gift card went into my secondary account instead.

Also, there were several sketchy things going on in that situation. First of all, that "support" messaged me in code blocks. Secondly, that guy who told me that they "reported" my account also *accidentally* sent the message to me as a code block too, but they deleted it shortly after. I suspect that the "support" and the "report guy" are the same person. Also, the only "proof" that they were the "support" is some screenshot of some sketchy-looking dashboard.

As I told you, they never paid me back. Which means that I've lost $250 to them through Steam gift cards bought from third-party websites. Thankfully, though, my account is still okay, after I contacted the *REAL* Steam Support to unlock it for me.

And that became the moral for me: whenever I suspect that the person I'm talking to is trying to scam me, end the conversation immediately. Block them, power off your phone, do whatever you can to stop that person from talking to you.
