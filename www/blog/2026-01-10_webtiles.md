Check it out [here in Tile 7,7](https://webtiles.kicya.net/#1875,1875)!

[Nekoweb](https://nekoweb.org) just hosted the event where you can claim a 250x250 tile and make a little page there to represent your main site, which I just did. However, there are some limitations, like you can't use any ES6 JavaScript features or these tags: `<iframe>`, `<object>`, `<embed>`, `<frame>`, `<frameset>`, `<svg>`, `<meta>`, `<title>`, `<base>`, `<applet>`, `<source>` and [more in WebTiles' tile](https://webtiles.kicya.net/#125,125).

My tile is very simple though. Just some links to my main website with some serif fonts. I can't explicitly use Noto Serif here because it doesn't allow you to use external resources. 

Also, **Firetruck** (because why not).
