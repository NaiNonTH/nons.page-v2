**Or,** You can also do this way: on the mod page, find the latest version (and the correct version for your game version) of the mod next to the description box below the mod details. Then, click the green download button to the right of the version name.

Although this method is the fastest way to download, you won't be able to see the dependencies or the changelog — which may includes the developer's message — of the mod.
