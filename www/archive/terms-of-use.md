title: Terms of Use
---

To prevent morons from lazily redistributing creations for only their advantage while allowing users to be creative with them, this Terms of Use was initiated.

You can read it on this document, or read it in [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1l1SMCGPHJh1Qa193TC0KxFu5ZUkc38HcuDRvHUreOb0/edit?usp=sharing).

## Referring and Notes

Before we understand my terms of use, let me tell you the definitions of the words I am referring to in this document. These words mentioned are case-insensitive, so no matter how they are capitalized, their definition stays permanent.

## Classes of License

There are four classes of NaiNonTheN00b1's Terms of Use, ordering from "Most Free" to "Most Strict.":

1. Class FFA
2. Class I
3. Class II
4. Class III
5. Class IV

### Class FFA

With this class of Terms of Use...

| -------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |

| Use them as material for other projects.           |
| Use them for all content creation of any kind.     |

NaiNonTheN00b1's Class FFA of ToU, besides following their main purpose, allows you to share, edit 'n publish, and use them as material, and within your content: Videos and Images for Social Media, Live Broadcasting, etc. without having to credit me. All rights go to you, the users — to fully use my material to be creative with them as much as possible.

### Class I

| Use them for (not all) content creation of any kind. |

In addition to [Class FFA](#class-ffa), NaiNonTheN00b1's Class I of ToU does not allow you to sell, claim my creations as your own, or use them for scamming, or false advertising, which can result in users falling into and cause damage to them. Using the same name as the original is also not permitted, as it can confuse users.

Also, you cannot sell, claim my creations as your own, or use them to cause time or money damage to others. In addition to the Class I ToU, redistribution of their original form is **_prohibited_**. If you “actually” would like to promote my creation, please provide a link to my creation page instead of entirely reposting them as a file. Again, using the same name as my creations' is not allowed.
