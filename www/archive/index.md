This is the **Archive page**: the page that collects documents from the Devsite that has already been shut down and source code from my old websites like Neocities website and the Devsite.

I'll be frank, I feel ashamed for this. But hey, it is for the history, at least.

## Old Documents

* [How to Download Minecraft Mod packs from Modrinth and GitHub](./how-to-download-minecraft-mod-packs-from-modrinth-and-github/)
* [Terms of Use](./terms-of-use/)

## Source Code

I hate them.

* [Devsite](https://github.com/NaiNonTH/dev-site)
* [Neocities Site](https://github.com/NaiNonTH/old-personal-site)

## Wix

Did you know that I made my first website on Wix? And [here it is](https://nainonth.wixsite.com/nainonthen00b1).
