Hello again, I'm **Non** *(title: NaiNonTH, NaiNonTheN00b1).* I'm a {{ age }}-year-old Thai student who is still studying in Computer Science somewhere in Thailand. I've been interested in making a website for a couple of years now, and I'm still on it.

## How I Came Up With My Title

I came up with **NaiNonTheN00b1** at the time when I played CS:GO with my online friends. It's built upon my previous title: NaiNonTH, since I wanted to get rid of the Thai branding on my name. All I did was change the *TH* at the end into *TheN00b1* because I knew that I sucked.

### And What About NaiNonTH?

NaiNonTH can be split into these three parts with their own meaning:

1. **Nai**: a romanized Thai word of นาย that means "Mr."
2. **Non**: my Thai nickname: นนท์
3. **TH**: A country code of Thailand.

And that's why I prefer you to call me Non or NaiNon and not Nai.

## Other Titles

Here are some of my other pen names:

* NotNaiNonTXD: used for my roblox display name
* NoncanbeZaza: old, but can still be found.
* Minekoonnon: too old.
* Koonnon: ancient.

## How Did I Start The Web Development Journey

When I was 14, I was introduced to HTML5 in school, and I did quite a good job at it. That said, however, my journey as a web developer didn't start until I was 18, when I found out that my online friend had just made a website. So that time, I relearned HTML5, but that wasn't it. I started learning CSS, JavaScript, and programming overall. And that's why I got myself into studying Computer Science.

## Me And Video Games

I can tell that Video Games are what I grew up with since my dad also played video games. I got my hands on a PSP, a PS3, an Xbox 360, and then my own PC. He told me that I always begged to play games on his PSP a lot, even if I had one.

Nowadays, though, I don't find myself obsessed with playing video games as much as I was before. Not so sure if it's because I'm getting old, or if I just have more things to do.

## My PC

Copied from my older website and also [osu! profile page](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/17144141), here is the specification of my PC. Although it's pretty old, it's still pretty good for my daily usage and games:

* **CPU:** Intel Core i5-8400
* **Motherboard:** ASUS PRIME B360-PLUS
* **RAM:** Kingston HyperX FURY 16GB/2666 DDR4 Dual-channel
* **GPU:** ASUS ROG STRIX GeForce GTX 1060 (6GB) GAMING
* **HDD:** WD Black 1TB
* **SSD:**
  * Lexar SSD 240GB
  * WD Blue 3D NAND SATA SSD 500GB
* **PSU:** Thermaltake 650W TR2 S

### My Accessories

* **Mouse:** [Saru MXB1 HAM White Wireless Gaming Mouse](https://www.itcity.in.th/en/product/SARU-GAMING-MOUSE-WIRELESS-MXB1-HAM-WHITE_PRD202408008080)
* **Keyboard:** [Loga Base 104 Wireless Mechanical Keyboard](https://logaworld.com/products/loga-base-104-barebone-wireless-mechanical-keyboard?variant=46457526845578) ([ChaThai Tactile switch](https://logaworld.com/products/loga-mechanical-keyboard-switches-nomyen-chathai-35-pcs-box?_pos=1&_psq=Cha+thai&_ss=e&_v=1.0&variant=46069987180682))
  * A little note that I bought this as a "DIY" set with switches and keycaps. Despite having a "DIY" in the name, the staff built it for me.
* **Headset:** Nubwo X98
* **Unbranded Mouse Mat**. It has a World Map Pattern, with the size of <span style="display:inline-block;">80 cm x 30 cm x 3 mm.</span>

Anything that I've used before will be mentioned here.

* **Mouse:** Neolution E-Sport Mirage (2019-2025)
* **Keyboard:** Neolution E-Sport Hera (2019-2025)
* **Headset:** Nubwo Tanger NO-15 (????-????: I stopped using it for so long that I can't remember the year I started and stopped using.)
