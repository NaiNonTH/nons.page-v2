Hi, I'm **Non**, and welcome to my very personal website: [nons.page](/). This is my home of interests, collections of projects, life, and thoughts.

This is the *Second Generation* of nons.page, where simplicity remains top priority and is brought even further.

At the very top is the **Breadcrumbs**, where you can navigate to the parent of the current page easily. Currently, you're on the Home page, so you can only see "Home," as it lives at the **root** of the website and doesn't have a parent.

And underneath, after the article, is the **Page Navigation**, where you can discover other pages on my website.
